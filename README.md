# RoguelikeTutorial

## Conversion of the [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

This is a conversion of the [Revised Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) to use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).  The goal of this conversion is to stay as true as possible to the original tutorial while utilizing methods best suited to Godot.

*Disclaimer: I have limited experience with Godot and will be doing my best to stay true to what I have seen done.  If someone finds something which could be done in a more appropriate way, please let me know.  Thanks!*
